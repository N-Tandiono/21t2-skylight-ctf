Haha I just learnt about this RSA stuff and people are talking about it taking more time than the heat death of the universe to crack! My data is secure you will never find out what my favourite number is.

**Note:** When decrypted you will get a number, there is no need to wrap the number with `SKYLIGHT{}`.

**Note 2 - Electric Boogaloo**: Don't attempt to brute force this. We'll be monitoring submission logs.
