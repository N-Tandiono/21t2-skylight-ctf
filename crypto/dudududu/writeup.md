### Idea
Audio morse code

### Walkthrough
1. Zoom in all the way at the beginning of the audacity project where there is a strange blip of audio
2. Take note of the lines - each line up is a '-', each line down is '.', each gap of length 1 is a gap between letters and each gap of length 2 is a gap between words
3. Once you've transcribed the morse code translate it and add underscores inbetween each word.
