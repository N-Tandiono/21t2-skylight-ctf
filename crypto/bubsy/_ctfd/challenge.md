I've been reading the 1996 Gamespot review of the legendary Bubsy 3D for the Playstation and they are saying some really strange things like it is supposedly a "terrible game", luckily my local hacker friend gave me a code that should prove the true quality of this masterpiece, I just can't quite figure out the code...

Wrap your found result in SKYLIGHT{}.
