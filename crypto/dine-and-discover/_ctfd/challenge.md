My ramen restaurant is currently experiencing a power outage, and my front-of-house employee doesn't have a mobile data plan, and can't scan our customer's NSW Dine and Discover voucher.

They just called me to explain the situation, and asked me to scan the voucher on my end. They've sent the voucher over the phone as... a repeating series of beeps??? I can't figure out how to decode it.

Please help me out... they're really expecting a quick response.

You can listen in on the telephone line by connecting to it at `nc pwn.ctf.unswsecurity.com 5007`.

Note: The 'telephone line' doesn't respond to any input.
