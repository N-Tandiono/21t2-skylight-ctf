I want to start a movie rental business, I'm thinking of calling it "I-Sequel"...
Get it?? Because sequel... and movies... 

No?  

Well, moving on, as usual, that's only the official one, the other business is uhhh... to be kept private.  

As such, I would like you to test it out, thanks :)

Btw, I'm thinking of calling it My-Sequel...  
Get it? Get it?? Cause its my _second_ business...  
_sequel_...  
No?
