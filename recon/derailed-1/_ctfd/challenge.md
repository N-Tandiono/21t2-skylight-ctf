Find the following details about the pictured train accident and submit them as the flag.

`SKYLIGHT{nearesttown/suburb_date_approxtime_locomotivenumber_leftmosttrainregistration}`

- the approximate time of the crash was 3:15pm local time,
- the number of the locomotive hauling the passenger train is A1234,
- the registration of the train in the left of the image is 5AB6,

the flag would then be `SKYLIGHT{exampletown_060920_1515_A1234_5AB6}`.
