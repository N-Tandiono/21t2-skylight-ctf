We highly suspect that a diplomat who was at a foreign embassy was actually here for intelligence purposes.

However, they've suddenly fled the country. They accidentally left a USB behind though, and it seems that they've been spying on live satellite feeds of some of our airports.

We haven't been able to identify this airport yet though. Can you help us? **You can assume that magnetic north is directly up in the image.**

Your flag should be the ICAO code for the airport, wrapped with `SKYLIGHT{}`. For example, if this was Sydney Airport, your flag would be `SKYLIGHT{YSSY}.

**Do not attempt to brute force this challenge.** We will be monitoring submission logs.
