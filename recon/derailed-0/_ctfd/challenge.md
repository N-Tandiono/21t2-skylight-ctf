Here's a weirdly distorted image of a train accident which I'm trying to research for a project...

Find the Wikipedia page for the type of passenger carriage featured in the image, and wrap the last section of the URL with Skylight. For example, if the answer was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_AK_class_carriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_AK_class_carriage), the flag would be `SKYLIGHT{New_Zealand_AK_class_carriage}`.
