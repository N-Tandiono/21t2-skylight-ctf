## Description
Due to budget cuts, Mathletics has become too expensive for my school to afford. I've decided to subscribe my students to Catletics instead. It's 95% cheaper, but requires students to connect using `nc pwn.ctf.unswsecurity.com 5008`, and has a 10 second time limit to save bandwidth.

I think it's an effective learning tool! I really hope none of my students know how to use pwntools...
