While this CTF has a wide variety of challenges with different difficulties, there's a SecSoc CTF just for beginners in collaboration with CSESoc soon!

Find the time that the CTF is scheduled to start in ISO8601 format (without separators, and using the same timezone as the event) and wrap it with `SKYLIGHT{}`.
