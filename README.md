# 2021 Skylight Cyber CTF

Repository for challenges in the 2021 O-Week CTF, with writeups for most challenges, and source code included so that you can run it for yourself.

Want to submit your own community writeup for a challenge (even one which already has one)? Make a pull request! We love to see different approaches to solving problems. 

We hope you had fun participating in the CTF! Stay tuned for updates on future CTFs and events, such as the Reverse Engineering with Ghidra workshop with Skylight Cyber, and the Newbie CTF with CSESoc!
